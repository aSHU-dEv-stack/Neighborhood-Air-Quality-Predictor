# Air Quality Prediction Web Application

This project is a web-based application for predicting air quality using TensorFlow.js for in-browser machine learning.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **ML (in-browser)**: TensorFlow.js (train or load model in browser)
- **Data source**: Public datasets (OpenAQ or government API) or CSV upload for prototype
- **Optional backend**: 
  - Node/Java service for data ingestion and model training
  - Firebase/Firestore for storage and analytics

## Project Structure

The project is organized into weekly folders to track progress:

- **Week 1**: Project setup, basic UI, and data visualization
- **Week 2**: Data loading and preprocessing
- **Week 3**: TensorFlow.js integration, model training and deployment
